# gsoc-2026-data-engineering
This repository documents my focused preparation for Google Summer of Code (GSOC) 2026 
with an emphasis on data engineering.

It includes:
- Clean Python implementations for data processing
- SQL queries for analytical and engineering use-cases
- End-to-end ETL pipeline experiments
- Notes and design decisions made while learning

The goal is not certificates, but production-ready thinking and 
open-source contribution readiness.
