GSOC 2026 — Data Engineering Preparation

Overview

This repository documents my focused preparation for Google Summer of Code (GSOC) 2026, with a strong emphasis on data engineering fundamentals and open-source readiness.
The goal of this repository is not certificates, but to demonstrate:
Production-oriented thinking
Consistent engineering practice
Readiness to contribute to real-world open-source data systems

Objectives

Build a strong foundation in Python and SQL for data engineering
Design and implement end-to-end ETL pipelines
Understand data workflows, orchestration, and scalability concepts
Transition from structured learning to open-source contributions
Prepare a competitive GSOC 2026 proposal

Tech Stack

Programming: Python
Databases: PostgreSQL, SQL
Data Engineering Concepts: ETL pipelines, data processing
Learning Platform: DataCamp

Version Control: Git & GitHub

Learning & Execution Strategy

Daily hands-on coding (no passive learning)
Every concept learned is backed by working code
Small but complete implementations over unfinished “big ideas”
Clear documentation of decisions, trade-offs, and assumptions

Current Focus (February 2026)

Python fundamentals for data manipulation
SQL for analytical and engineering use-cases
Core data engineering concepts (ETL, pipelines)
Building reproducible mini-projects
Early engagement with GSOC organizations

Long-Term Roadmap

Advanced ETL pipelines and data modeling
Workflow orchestration (e.g., Airflow)
Scalable data processing concepts
Active open-source contributions
GSOC 2026 proposal development and refinement

Commitment

Daily study & coding: 3–4 hours minimum
Daily GitHub activity
Strong focus on clarity, consistency, and execution

Note to Mentors

This repository represents active, ongoing work.
I value feedback, best practices, and community-driven development.

Status

In Progress — February 2026
